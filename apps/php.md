# PHP (plain)

- Action: **create**
- Current source: None; new app required
- Planned canonical repository: `xCloudNobin/deploy-test-php`
- Current source visibility: Not created; intended public
- Initial status: **not-started; deployment not verified**

## Implementation brief

Plain PHP, no Laravel; PDO storage, sessions and documented web-root routing.

Implement the shared meaningful-app baseline: UI, validated CRUD, persistent storage, schema setup, production configuration, health/readiness and automated smoke/persistence checks. Use a project/task board unless the specific requirement preserves another domain.

## Required deliverables

- [ ] Verify source owner; resolve any pending transfer before creating a destination.
- [ ] Inspect/reuse the existing source if provided; implement the brief, not a success-page shell.
- [ ] Include license/attribution, README, safe environment example and reproducible dependencies.
- [ ] Document install/build/production start, runtime version, port/bind address, health, schema and persistence.
- [ ] Automated positive/negative smoke tests; applicable restart/redeploy persistence test.
- [ ] Real local production verification and reviewable PR with exact commit and evidence.
- [ ] Separate live xCloud qualification using the intended category before marking deployment verified.

Read [ACCEPTANCE.md](../ACCEPTANCE.md) and [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Return evidence and blockers to the coordinator; do not self-merge or change repository visibility.
